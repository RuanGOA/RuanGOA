### What's up, I'm Ruan :grin:

I am a student of computer science at the Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). I love to develop projects that are outside my scope, I feel that it makes me learn more. I am interested in learning about everything, and lately I have been dedicated to data science and web programming.


Currently working at @SPLab on the ePol project.


*Everything is lesson* :rocket:
