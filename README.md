### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a computer science student at Federal University of Campina Grande (UFCG). I really enjoy creating useful scripts for specific situations :rofl:. Interested in all areas, but I seek to learn about data science and web programming. I consider solving problems a hobby :grin:.


Currently working at @SPLab on the ePol project.


*Everything is lesson* :rocket:
